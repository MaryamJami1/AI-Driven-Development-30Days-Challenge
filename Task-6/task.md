# Task 6: Connect GitHub MCP Server with Google Gemini CLI

I need to connect the GitHub MCP Server with Google Gemini CLI using the Hosted (Remote) MCP Server method.

## What this task involves
- Setting up GitHub MCP Server connection
- Using the Hosted/Remote MCP Server approach
- No Docker or local MCP installation needed (easiest method)

## Goal
Once completed, the AI will be able to:
- Read GitHub repositories
- Interact with GitHub directly

## Notes
- This is the simplest connection method
- Everything runs remotely, no local setup required
