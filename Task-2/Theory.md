### Nine Pillars Understanding

1. Why is using AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) for repetitive setup tasks better for your growth as a system architect?  
Using AI agents for boring repetitive work (like creating folders, config files, and boilerplate code) saves a lot of time. 
This frees you to focus on high-level architecture decisions instead of wasting energy on small, mechanical tasks.

2. Explain how the Nine Pillars of AIDD help a developer grow into an M-Shaped Developer  
- **Clarity Skills** – You learn to explain problems clearly so the AI understands exactly what you want.  
- **Architecture Design & System Thinking** – You start seeing the whole system: its parts, how data flows, and where the boundaries are.  
- **AI-Assisted Coding** – You work with AI as a smart partner. You give it precise instructions, and it builds complex features for you.  
- **Rule-Based Thinking** – You learn to set clear rules, constraints, and standards for every part of the system.  
- **System Mastery** – You control the full AI workflow and act like both a system architect and an AI conductor at the same time.

### Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development

1. Why does Vibe Coding usually create problems after one week?  
Vibe Coding has no real plan or structure. You just start coding based on a feeling. After about a week, the project becomes messy, hard to understand, full of bugs, difficult to maintain, and almost impossible to scale.

2. How would Specification-Driven Development prevent those problems?  
Specification-Driven Development forces you to create a clear plan (a blueprint) before writing any code. Both you and the AI follow the same plan, so the project stays organized, consistent, easy to maintain, and simple to expand later.



### Architecture Thinking

1. How does architecture-first thinking change the role of a developer in AIDD?  
In AI-Driven Development (AIDD), the developer stops being just a person who types code. Instead, you become a system designer and orchestrator. Your main job is to define how the system should work, how the parts connect, and how AI agents should cooperate to build everything.

2. Explain why developers must think in layers and systems instead of raw code.  
Modern software is large and complex. If you only think about individual lines of code, the project quickly becomes confusing and unmanageable. Thinking in layers and systems keeps everything clear and organized. It makes the project easier to build, grow, debug, and explain to AI tools.



# Reflection
This task shows how fast the developer job is changing in the AI age.  
Tools like the Nine Pillars, Spec-Driven Development, and AI agents aren’t just helpers they completely change how we plan, build, and maintain software.  

When you start thinking architecture first and team up with AI agents, you stop being just a coder. You become a system thinker.  
Keep practicing this way and you’ll grow into an M-Shaped developer: someone with deep skills in several areas, plus the power of smart AI tools.
