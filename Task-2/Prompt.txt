CLI prompt:
Write a single, well-written paragraph that serves as a complete technical specification for an email validation function in a backend application. The function must:
- Check that the email contains exactly one "@" symbol
- Ensure there is at least one character before the "@"
- Ensure there is a domain after the "@" that contains at least one "." 
- Validate that the top-level domain (after the last ".") is between 2 and 63 characters and contains only letters
- Support common TLDs such as .com, .org, .net, .io, .co.uk, etc. (no hardcoded list required, just reasonable validation)
- Return an object with { isValid: boolean } and { error: string | null } that provides clear, user-friendly error messages (examples: "Email is missing the @ symbol", "Invalid domain name", "Top-level domain is too short", etc.)
- Be case-insensitive
- Trim whitespace automatically

Write only the one-paragraph specification, no code, no bullet points, no extra text.





CLI Output:
The email validation function shall accept a string input and return an object containing an isValid boolean and an error string (null if valid). It must first trim whitespace from the input and perform validation in a case-insensitive manner. 
The function must verify the presence of exactly one "@" character, with at least one non-whitespace character before it and after it. Following the "@", it must confirm the existence of at least one "." in the domain portion, ensuring the top-level domain (the substring after the final ".") 
consists solely of letters and is between 2 and 63 characters in length. 
Common country-code and generic top-level domains such as .com, .org, .net, .io, and .co.uk are implicitly supported through these rules without maintaining an exhaustive whitelist.
If any check fails, the function must return isValid: false along with a clear, human-readable error message in the error field (e.g., "Email must contain exactly one @ symbol", "Local part cannot be empty", "Invalid domain format", "Top-level domain must be 2–63 letters only"). 
Only when all criteria are satisfied will the function return isValid: true and error: null.
