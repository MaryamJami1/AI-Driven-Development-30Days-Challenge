### **1. What Are MCP Servers?**

MCP servers are like a **middleman** between your AI (like Gemini CLI) and the tools it needs.

They help your AI safely use things like:

* Files
* APIs
* Local functions
* External systems (GitHub, Firebase, etc.)

**Simple meaning:**
An MCP server gives Gemini CLI **extra tools** so it can *do real actions*, not just give text replies.

---

### **2. Why MCP Servers Are Useful**

* They allow you to **add new powers** to an AI instantly.
* They follow a standard format, so they work easily with different systems.
* They remove complicated setup you don’t need to connect every tool manually.
* They make your project easier to manage.
* Students can use them **without writing heavy backend code**.

### **3. The Problem**

Gemini CLI **cannot build full agents on its own**.
It has **weak agent-building support**, so making complete agents inside Gemini CLI becomes difficult and annoying.

---

### **4. The Solution — Context7**

There is a platform called **Context7**.
It works as **one powerful MCP server**.

**What it provides:**

* Python docs
* OpenAgents SDK docs
* Supabase docs
* FastAPI docs
* Docs for all modern frameworks
* Auto updated documentation

(If OpenAgents SDK updates → Context7 updates instantly.)

### **Why Context7 Is Perfect**

When you ask Gemini CLI to build an agent using OpenAgents SDK:

* It won’t give errors
* It will use the correct, updated documentation
* It will understand the latest workflows
* Students don’t need to find or read new docs
* Everything stays compatible and up-to-date

**In short:**
Context7 removes the biggest problem it helps Gemini CLI understand how to build agents properly.
