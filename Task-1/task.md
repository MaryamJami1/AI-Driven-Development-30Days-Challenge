Q1:
What does AI Driven Development mean to you?
AI Driven Development means using AI as a partner in the software building process. 
It helps me think faster, write better code, and solve problems more efficiently. 
Instead of doing everything manually, I use AI to speed up development and improve the quality of my work.

Q2:
How do you see the future of Human–AI Collaboration in software development?
I think humans and AI will work together like a team. Developers will focus on ideas,
logic, and creativity, while AI will handle repetitive tasks, suggest improvements, and help avoid mistakes. 
AI won’t replace developers it will make them smarter, faster, and more capable.




Key Concepts (in my own words)

1. AI Turning Point (Oct 2025)
   This was the moment when tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude became very advanced, and AI assisted coding became normal for everyone.

2. Agentic AI
   These are AI systems that can think, plan, and take actions on their own without needing constant instructions.

3. Evaluation-Driven Development (EvDD)
   This means checking the AI’s output, improving it, correcting mistakes, and guiding AI step by step until the result is accurate.

4. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
   A method where tests are written first and the code later. It still plays an important role even when using AI for development.

5. AI Productivity Boom
   AI tools now help developers work much faster, sometimes 5 to 10 times more productive than before.





Self Test (MCQs)

1. What is the main purpose of the AI-Native Era?
   Answer: Empower developers through AI tools

2. What defines an AI-driven developer?
   Answer: Creates context-aware prompts

3. What does “AIDD” stand for?
   Answer: AI-Driven Development

4. What is the focus of Evaluation-Driven Development (EvDD)?
   Answer: Evaluating and improving AI outputs

5. What should developers focus on in the AI era?
   Answer: Building reasoning + evaluation skills



End-of-Day Reflection:
“Today I learned that AI isn’t replacing developers it’s redefining them. 
The 2025 Turning Point proved that coding is no longer just syntax; it’s about reasoning, collaboration, and strategy.”
